# bookbot

BookBot is my first [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project!

Bookbot works by running the main.py file with 1 other argument:
python3 main.py <path_to_book>
If it has the incorrect number of arguments, it prints the command usage before exiting.
With the correct arguments passed, it analyses the file; providing the total number of words and a ordered breakdown of the frequency of alphabetic characters before exiting.
